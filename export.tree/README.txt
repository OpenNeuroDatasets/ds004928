In vivo 7T MRI submillimeter dataset investigating the auditory system (cortical areas) collected at Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) and 
New York University (NYU) by Luca Vizioli and Zidan Yu respectively.

The dataset consists of 10 subjects that underwent one session in which anatomical MP2RAGE data and 6 to 8 functional runs were acquired at a resolution
of 0.8 mm isotropic. 

Participants passively listened to auditory tone sequences that could be either predictable, mispredicted or unpredictable. 
The initial purpose of this study was to investigate predictive processing in the human auditory cortex. However, the same dataset has first been used to 
investigate the effect of NORDIC denoising on our SNR limited high-resolution data.

## Known issues/comments
- For subject 1 the opposite phase encoding images are missing. Therefore, the folder fmap is empty.
